# Intramu Landing Page

This is the typical stylish landing page to attract attention and look cool for the public.

-   It will also contain information on the mobile app and its abilties and features.
-   There will be testimonials from students and schools showcasing it's abilities

This is a complete work in progress and is up to redesign by Stevan

Ultimately this should offer a cool looking login and signup page that will redirect users to the main web application
